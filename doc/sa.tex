\section{Background}

STIGQter is an open source tool used to perform RMF and STIG compliance mapping. As an open-source application, SA is performed by the STIGQter administrators on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/squinky86/STIGQter}.

\section{Purpose}

This documentation is meant to satisfy System and Services Acquisition (SA) requirements for RMF and detail what pieces of a SA policy may be covered by this application. SA requirements of roles (Section~\ref{sec:roles}) and their responsibilities (Section~\ref{sec:responsibilities}) provide integrity to the application.

\section{Scope}

The SA policy describes development process work and procedures.

\section{Roles}
\label{sec:roles}

The following role(s) are defined as being applicable to STIGQter execution:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{User} -- The user of the software is defined as the individual account given permissions to execute the software.
\end{enumerate}

The following role(s) are defined as being applicable to STIGQter GitHub administration:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Administrator} -- An administrator of the STIGQter GitHub project
\end{enumerate}

\section{Responsibilities}
\label{sec:responsibilities}

Responsibilities are described in the GPL version 3.

\section{Management Commitment}

STIGQter development is committed to occur in an approved open source repository for maximum visibility and distribution.

\section{Coordination}

No coordination with other organizations is required to operate this software.

\section{RMF Control Compliance}

\subsection{SA-4 -- Acquisition Process}

\subsubsection{SA-4(5) -- System / Component / Service Configurations}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3109, CCI-3110, CCI-3111

The application is delivered in a secure state and with no additional user accounts created.

\subsection{SA-5 -- Information System Documentation}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-642, CCI-3124, CCI-3125, CCI-3126, CCI-3127, CCI-3128, CCI-3129, CCI-3130, CCI-3131, CCI-3132, CCI-3133, CCI-3134, CCI-3135, CCI-3136

Application Configuration Guide is included as part of the Configuration, Installation, and Usage Guide. All documentation is maintained in the project's GitHub repository.

\subsection{SA-10 -- Developer Configuration Management}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-692, CCI-694, CCI-3155, CCI-3156, CCI-3157, CCI-3158, CCI-3159, CCI-3160, CCI-3161, CCI-3162, CCI-3163, CCI-3164

All development CM process data is handled in the CM documentation. Github is the authoritative source for documentation, design libraries, testing processes/tools, and test data. Each release produces a signed changelog which is tagged and archived in the git repository. This tagged release includes all items required to rebuild and repurpose that version of the software.

Only STIGQter administrators are able to control the github settings.

Security impacts of any changes are handled by immediate scans using the processes defined in section SA-11. Any identified security impact triggers a notification and issue report in github.

\subsubsection{SA-10(1) -- Software / Firmware Integrity Verification}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-698

The software is hashed with SHA512 and Blake2b512. Hashes are included with all final releases.

\subsection{SA-11 -- Developer Security Testing and Evaluation}
\label{sec:sa-11}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3171, CCI-3172, CCI-3173, CCI-3174, CCI-3175, CCI-3176, CCI-3177, CCI-3178

Scans are performed, at a minimum, on each release of the software. Most scans are performed with each commit of the source code using several automated tools. Github actions are configured to scan the development software. The following tools are run automatically in Github Action cronjobs or schedules at least monthly:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Codacity - Code Quality Scans
	\item Codecov - Code Coverage Analysis
	\item CodeFactor - Code Quality Scans
	\item CodeQL - Code Security Scans
	\item Codiga - Code Security and Quality Scans
	\item Coveralls - Code Coverage Analysis
	\item lgtm - Code Security and Quality Scans
	\item SonarCloud - Code Security and Quality Scans
	\item Sonatype Lift - Code Security and Quality Scans
\end{itemize}

Additionally, each release of the application is scanned by Coverity, Clazy, and Clang-Analyzer for defects. Github Actions are enabled for every commit, and additional security and quality checks are run using CodeQL, available in the Security tab of STIGQter's github project.

When quality or security defects are identified, they are resolved before the next release of the application. An application will not be released if high or critical risk findings are detected in the security or quality scans.

\subsubsection{SA-11(1) -- Static Code Analysis}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3179, CCI-3180

The CodeQL, Coverity, and SonarCloud scans defined in Section~\ref{sec:sa-11} provide static code capabilities that identify common flaws. The results are documented in the Application Security and Development STIG and are provided publicly on each of the aforementioned platforms from the STIGQter website. Security issues identified in any of the scans automatically create an issue in the github issue tracker.

\subsubsection{SA-11(2) -- Threat and Vulnerability Analyses}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3181, CCI-3182

Testing is the responsibility of the Administrators for the project on GitHub. Tests are run by Github Actions for every new commit.

\subsubsection{SA-11(3) -- Independent Verification of Assessment Plans / Evidence}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3183, CCI-3184, CCI-3185, CCI-3186

The scanning services listed in Section~\ref{sec:sa-11} are independent of the development team, publish their assessment results publicly, and have been granted full access to the source repositories.

\subsubsection{SA-11(4) -- Manual Code Reviews}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3187, CCI-3188, CCI-3189

The GitHub project administrators are responsible for verifying that the scanning documented in Section~\ref{sec:sa-11} is performed. Code coverage of security scans is 100\%.

\subsubsection{SA-11(8) -- Dynamic Code Analysis}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3196, CCI-3197

High and Critical risk security findings from the scans in Section~\ref{sec:sa-11} are tracked in the project's GitHub issue tracker. Some historical data is preserved in the cloud scanner's history.

\subsection{SA-12 -- Supply Chain Protection}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-722, CCI-723

The STIGQter source code is provided under the GPL as open source software. Dynamically linked dependencies are the responsibility of the one who builds the software. The STIGQter binary is compiled on appveyor and the Software Bill of Materials is included in the source code repository as \texttt{LICENSE.spdx}. This SBOM is maintained with the latest supported security updates of all STIGQter dependencies. Hashes of the supply chain verification are included in the SPDX SBOM.

\subsubsection{SA-12(1) -- Acquisition Strategies / Tools / Methods}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3198, CCI-3199

The tracing strategy is to broadcast the dependency acquisition in the public domain using the \texttt{LICENSE.spdx} file.

\subsubsection{SA-12(2) -- Supplier Reviews}

\paragraph{Applicable CCI:} CCI-3200

All suppliers are included in the automated software composition analysis conducted on all dependencies for the application.

\subsubsection{SA-12(7) -- Assessments Prior To Selection / Acceptance / Update}

\paragraph{Applicable CCI:} CCI-3203

Dependencies have not changed since STIGQter was released. Dependencies were assessed by conducting a vulnerability analysis on each component and subscribing to their update channels.

\subsubsection{SA-12(10) -- Validate As Genuine And Not Altered}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3212, CCI-3213

Hashes are checked against the releases of all dependencies. The hashes are documented in \texttt{LICENSE.spdx} for verification against changes.

\subsubsection{SA-12(13) -- Critical Information System Components}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3218, CCI-3219, CCI-3220

This is software and is not an information system. All dependencies are available from their unique websites and channels. Qt updates are obtained from qt.io. OpenSSL updates are obtained from openssl.org. All other dependencies are available via their respective github release channels. Only the official release channels are used for obtaining of the releases, and as software, the only limitations are on the licenses, which have been verified as compatible with the GPL.

\subsubsection{SA-12(15) -- Processes To Address Weaknesses Or Deficiencies}

\paragraph{Applicable CCI:} CCI-3224

Supply chain vulnerabilities are identified as part of the software composition analysis performed in the SA-11 and SA-15 processes. Issues are triaged through the same processes as Section~\ref{sec:sa-15-10}.

\subsection{SA-15 -- Development Process, Standards, and Tools}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3233, CCI-3234, CCI-3235, CCI-3236, CCI-3237, CCI-3238, CCI-3239, CCI-3240, CCI-3241, CCI-3242, CCI-3243, CCI-3244, CCI-3245, CCI-3246

The \href{http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-functions}{C++ Core Guidelines} are used as the standard for development. The \href{https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html}{Google C++ Style Guide}, \href{https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/downloads/secure-coding/assets/sei-cert-cpp-coding-standard-2016-v01.pdf}{CERT Coding Standards}, and \href{https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Coding_Style}{Qt Coding Style} are used as secondary references.

Since there is a single user role for the application, the design document is defined as the User's Guide.

Security requirements are to perform the testing listed in Section~\ref{sec:sa-11}. Changes to these requirements are stored in the GitHub changelog for each file. Reviews of this process occur for every major release.

\subsubsection{SA-15(4) -- Threat Modeling / Vulnerability Analysis}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3256, CCI-3257, CCI-3258, CCI-3259, CCI-3260, CCI-3261, CCI-3262, CCI-3263, CCI-3264, CCI-3265, CCI-3266, CCI-3267, CCI-3268, CCI-3269, CCI-3270, CCI-3271

Vulnerability analysis includes the scans listed in Section~\ref{sec:sa-11}.

The following sections are required by STIG rule SV-85011r1\_rule:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Identified Threats:} none
	\item \textbf{Potential Vulnerabilities:} XML Bomb (Lots of Laughs attack, \href{https://github.com/squinky86/STIGQter/issues/26}{issue \#26})
	\item \textbf{Counter Measures Taken:} none; The threat of malicious CKL files is well-documented.
	\item \textbf{Potential Mitigations:} Train the user not to open CKL files from unknown sources.
	\item \textbf{Mitigations Selected based on Risk Analysis:} A risk acceptance is recommended.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{SA-15(5) -- Attack Surface Reduction}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3272, CCI-3273

Error handling vulnerabilities are included in the scanning process of Section~\ref{sec:sa-11}.

\subsubsection{SA-15(10) -- Incident Response Plan}
\label{sec:sa-15-10}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3289

All incidents should be logged as issues in the GitHub project's issue tracker. These incidents will be triaged on a best-effort basis.

\subsection{SA-22 -- Unsupported System Components}

\paragraph{Applicable CCIs:} CCI-3374, CCI-3376

When a dependency is updated for a security reason, the build revision of STIGQter is automatically updated as well to enforce updates. This includes vulnerabilities in any of the dependent components. For example, if STIGQter 1.0.0 is released and the next day a Qt vulnerability is released that affects STIGQter, STIGQter documentation will be updated and a new release of STIGQter 1.0.1 will occur. New releases are made available on https://www.stigqter.com/.

When no longer supported, the STIGQter website will be updated to reflect its status.

\paragraph{Non-Applicable CCI(s):} CCI-3375

There is no justification to use outdated components. Only supported products and dependencies are accepted.
